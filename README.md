## 1. 🛠️ TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

**HYDRA-UMC-ORCHESTRATOR** is the high-level coordination layer of the HYDRA-UMC ecosystem. It manages multiple HydraNodes (Kinematic Brains, Vision Nodes, and Cognitive Nodes) as a single, unified swarm.

It handles global mission planning, load balancing across the fleet, and real-time synchronization between robots to prevent physical collisions and ensure millimetric precision in multi-robot collaborative tasks.

### Key Features:
* 🕸️ **Swarm Coordination:** Orchestrates up to 32+ independent robot arms across multiple controllers.
* ⚖️ **Load Balancing:** Automatically assigns missions to the most available or best-equipped robot.
* 🛡️ **Centralized Safety:** Global E-STOP management and fleet-wide health monitoring.
* 📡 **Unified API:** Provides a single entry point for APPs and Studios to interact with the entire factory.
* 🧩 **Real v0 - Mission State Machine:** `mission.rs` tracks every mission through `Pending -> Dispatched -> InProgress -> Completed` (plus `Cancelled`/`Failed` terminal states), with idempotent cancellation and real recovery when a node is reported unreachable/invalid - see `mission-demo` below. Pure in-memory logic - no live JOB-DISPATCHER/NODE-HEALING gRPC peer needed to run or test it.

## 3. 🧠 ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN DECISIONS

> The internal layers below are the planned design for the logic that will
> sit behind this entry point - see "🔧 BUILD & RUN" further down for what
> actually runs today: a real, pure in-memory mission state machine
> (`mission.rs`), still without any live network peer to talk to.

**Planned internal layers**, to be built out incrementally on top of the
real state machine that already exists:
* **API layer** — receives high-level mission requests from Studios/Apps
  and translates them into fleet-level actions.
* **Mission queue integration** — hands accepted missions off to
  JOB-DISPATCHER and tracks their lifecycle across the fleet using the
  real `Mission`/`MissionRegistry` state machine that already exists in
  `mission.rs` - what's still missing is the gRPC wiring to a real
  JOB-DISPATCHER to hand missions off to.
* **PTP-synced dispatch** — coordinates timing with SWARM-SYNC so multiple
  robots executing the same mission stay collision-free per
  PATH-PLANNER-3D's checks.
* **Fleet health aggregation** — consumes NODE-HEALING's per-node signals
  into a single fleet-wide view and calls `MissionRegistry::recover_node_unavailable()`
  (already real) once each signal arrives; this is also the path a global
  E-STOP would travel through to reach every node at once.

### Why Rust for this specific service
This process is the one with the most authority over the fleet: it is what
would issue a global E-STOP and arbitrate which robot gets which mission.
That role needs deterministic, low-latency coordination — no garbage
collector pauses that could delay a safety-critical stop — and
compile-time memory/type safety, since a crash or a data race here does
not stay local: it can leave the whole swarm without its coordinator
mid-mission. Two of this orchestrator's own children (JOB-DISPATCHER,
NODE-HEALING) use Go instead, a good fit for their simpler, more isolated
jobs; it is not the trade-off this particular "brain" process needs.

### Design decisions
* **Only process with a family-wide `docker-compose.yml`.** As the
  integration parent of SWARM-SYNC, PATH-PLANNER-3D, JOB-DISPATCHER and
  NODE-HEALING, this repository is the natural place to describe how the
  whole family runs together — each child's own repo stays focused on
  itself.
* **Exposes a "Unified API" for Apps/Studios.** Rather than every client
  (mobile apps, desktop Studios) talking to 4 separate child services
  directly, they talk to one stable entry point here, which stays free to
  route to whichever child implementation changes underneath it.
* **Why `cancel()` is idempotent instead of erroring on an already-cancelled mission.** A cancel request can legitimately arrive twice - a client retrying after a dropped response, an operator clicking cancel again before seeing confirmation. Treating the second call as a success (`AlreadyCancelled`, not an error) means the caller never has to distinguish "my cancel worked" from "someone else's cancel already worked" - both are the same good outcome. Cancelling a `Completed`/`Failed` mission is still refused: that is a genuinely different, non-idempotent situation (undoing finished work), not a retry.
* **Why node-failure recovery requeues to `Pending` instead of failing the mission outright.** A node reporting `UNREACHABLE` might be mid-restart rather than permanently gone (see `HYDRA-UMC-NODE-HEALING`'s own bounded-retry logic, which already absorbs transient blips before ever reporting a node down at all) - so a mission caught on that node gets a fresh shot at a different node via `Pending`, rather than being marked `Failed` on the first sign of trouble. `fail()` still exists for when redispatch genuinely runs out of options.

For every real `mission-demo`/CLI example (captured from an actual built binary), see [`docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md`](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md). For the shared `hydra.common.v1` gRPC contract itself - what it defines, why it lives in this repo, and how each language generates its own bindings from it - see [`proto/README.md`](proto/README.md).

is a pure software service (Rust binary) with no dedicated hardware or
firmware of its own, and no operating system image to maintain.

## 🔧 BUILD & RUN GUIDE

Bare invocation stays a minimal skeleton (prints identity, exits 0); the
real mission state machine is exercisable today via `mission-demo`.

```bash
# Windows
build.bat
run.bat
run.bat mission-demo

# Linux / macOS
./build.sh
./run.sh
./run.sh mission-demo
```

`build.sh`/`build.bat` bump the version in `Cargo.toml` (ecosystem-wide
odometer rule, see `bump_version.py`) and then run `cargo build --release`.
`run.sh`/`run.bat` execute the resulting binary directly.

`mission-demo` runs a real scenario end-to-end against `mission.rs`'s
`MissionRegistry` and prints every real transition:

```text
[orchestrator] mission-1: dispatched -> InProgress(node=node-a)
[orchestrator] mission-2: dispatched -> Dispatched(node=node-a)
[orchestrator] mission-3: dispatched -> InProgress(node=node-b)
[orchestrator] node-a reported UNREACHABLE by NODE-HEALING - recovering its missions
[orchestrator] mission-1: requeued -> Pending
[orchestrator] mission-2: requeued -> Pending
[orchestrator] mission-3: unaffected (different node) -> InProgress(node=node-b)
[orchestrator] mission-2: cancel() -> Cancelled -> Cancelled
[orchestrator] mission-2: cancel() again (idempotent) -> AlreadyCancelled -> Cancelled
[orchestrator] mission-3: complete() -> Completed(node=node-b)
[orchestrator] mission-4: fail() -> Failed(no healthy node accepted redispatch after 3 attempts)
[orchestrator] final registry state:
  mission-1: Pending (terminal=false)
  mission-2: Cancelled (terminal=true)
  mission-3: Completed(node=node-b) (terminal=true)
  mission-4: Failed(no healthy node accepted redispatch after 3 attempts) (terminal=true)
```

```bash
cargo test   # 42 tests: every transition, every invalid-transition
             # rejection, idempotent cancel, and node-failure recovery
```

As the ecosystem's integration parent, this repo also ships a real
`docker-compose.yml` that builds and runs itself together with its 4
children (SWARM-SYNC, PATH-PLANNER-3D, JOB-DISPATCHER, NODE-HEALING),
checked out as sibling folders:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## 🚀 ROADMAP
* **Phase 1:** Deterministic swarm synchronization over TSN and sub-ms jitter reduction.
* **Phase 2:** 3D Path planning with dynamic obstacle avoidance in multi-robot cells.
* **Phase 3:** Multi-robot job dispatching optimization using real-time resource availability.
* **Phase 4:** High-availability failover cluster implementation and heterogeneous robot support.
